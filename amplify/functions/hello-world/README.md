Getting a working debugging setup for typescript based lambdas was an absolute nightmare. I initially aborted the attempt and decided to just stick with javascript for lambdas, but it turns out that using the generated graphql client (typescript by default but javascript possible with a bit of twiddling) is also non-trivial. I finally found this [https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/an-effective-way-to-debug-serverless-typescript] write up, which showed that the problems are due to a bug in the sam build build process and gave a workaround.
