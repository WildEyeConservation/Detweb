/**
 * Measures how long a user actually worked on something, rather than how long
 * it was open.
 *
 * Elapsed time is accumulated between user interactions; any gap longer than
 * the idle threshold is treated as away-from-keyboard and excluded. That
 * matters for long, high-variance tasks — an image pair holding 200 animals
 * can legitimately take half an hour, so a cap loose enough to be fair to it
 * would also swallow a lunch break.
 *
 * The species labelling workflow instead records plain wall-clock between the
 * task becoming visible and being submitted, bounded by a tight per-task cap
 * (see useCreateObservation). That works there because a task is inherently
 * short; it does not transfer to this shape of work.
