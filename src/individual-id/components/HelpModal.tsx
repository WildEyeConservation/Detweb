            marker still sits at the object's real position on the map; toggle
            the flag from the marker's popup. This is <em>not</em> the same as

            ignored by linking, accepting and pair completion. You can still
            drag it, or use its popup to change its label or delete it.
            Changing its label to the label you are working on promotes it
            into the workflow as a normal marker.
